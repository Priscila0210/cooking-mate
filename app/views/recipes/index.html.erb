      As soon as I downloaded the app and put a profile picture with
      my specialty in pasta and Italian food, I already received several
      invitations to a culinary meeting. That happened 1 year ago,
      until today we are still friends and we discovered that besides
      food we have many other professional and personal affinities.
      It was my best match!

        <p></p>
      My name is Martin, my new friends here on the app call me Ricky Martin the Big Boss,
      because I prepared for them one of my culinary specialties from Spain Paeja with baked seafood.
      That's why I got the name Chief. Thank you very much friends, it was a wonderful time!

        I have a hectic professional life, I'm always away from home so
        I do my homework outside. But after discovering this app, I can gather friends
        at my house and learn new special recipes from around the world.
        I want to thank here my friend Ana MÃ¼ller who for the moments and meals together,
        thank you.

      <p></p>
      I would like to thank this one because it was through him that I had wonderful
      moments with my friend Emma at that time. After a year on the app,
      Emma and I got married and learned several new dishes.
      Today in our house we are teaching our friends and neighbors how to cook.
