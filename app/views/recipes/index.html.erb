      As soon as I downloaded the app and put a profile picture with
      my specialty in pasta and Italian food, I already received several
      invitations to a culinary meeting. That happened 1 year ago,
      until today we are still friends and we discovered that besides
      food we have many other professional and personal affinities.
      It was my best match!

      My name is Martin, my new friends here on the app call me Ricky Martin the Big Boss,
      because I prepared for them one of my culinary specialties from Spain Paeja with baked seafood.
      That's why I got the name Chief. Thank you very much friends, it was a wonderful time!

        I have a hectic professional life, I'm always away from home so
        I do my homework outside. But after discovering this app, I can gather friends
        at my house and learn new special recipes from around the world.
        I want to thank here my friend Ana MÃ¼ller who for the moments and meals together,
        thank you.

      I would like to thank this one because it was through him that I had wonderful
      moments with my friend Emma at that time. After a year on the app,
      Emma and I got married and learned several new dishes.
      Today in our house we are teaching our friends and neighbors how to cook.
